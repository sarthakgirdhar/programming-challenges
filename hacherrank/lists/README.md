##Problem Statement

When we talk about storing multiple values in a container-like data-structure, the first thing that comes to mind is a *list*.

You can initialize a list as

    >>> arr = list()
    or simply
    >>> arr = []

or with a few elements as


    >>> arr = [1,2,3]

Elements can be accessed easily like you do in most programming languages.

    >>> print arr[0]
    1
    >>> print arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2]
    6
Lists in python are very versatile. If you ask what you can add in a Python List, the answer is practically anything!

In python you can create a list of any object, be it string, integers, or even lists. You can even add multiple types in a single list! Isn't that exciting?

Let's look at some of the methods you can use on List.



1.) append(x) 

Adds a single element 'x' to the end of list.

    >>> arr.append(9)   
    >>> print arr  
    [1, 2, 3, 9]

2.) extend(L) 

Merges another list 'L' to the end.

    >>> arr.extend([10,11])
    >>> print arr
    [1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11]

3.) insert (i,x) 

Inserts element 'x' at position 'i'.

    >>> arr.insert(3,7)
    >>> print arr
    [1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 10, 11]

4.) remove(x) 

Removes the first occurrence of element x.

    >>> arr.remove(10)  
    >>> arr  
    [1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 11]

5.) pop() 

Removes the last element of list. If an argument is passed, that index item is popped out.

    >>> temp = arr.pop()
    >>> print temp 
    11

6.) index(x) 

Returns the first index of a value in the list. Throws error if it's not found.

    >>> temp = arr.index(3)
    >>> print temp
    2

7.) count(x) 

Counts the number of occurrences of an element x.

    >>> temp = arr.count(1)
    >>> print temp
    1

8.) sort() 

Sorts the list.

    >>> arr.sort()
    >>> print arr
    [1, 2, 3, 7, 9]

9.) reverse() 

Reverses the list.

    >>> arr.reverse()
    >>> print arr
    [9, 7, 3, 2, 1]

###Task 

You have to initialize your list **L = []** and follow the ***N*** commands given in ***N*** lines.

Commands will be 1 of the 8 commands as given above, other than extend, and each command will have its value separated by space.

Follow this example:

###Sample Input

    12
    insert 0 5
    insert 1 10
    insert 0 6
    print 
    remove 6
    append 9
    append 1
    sort 
    print
    pop
    reverse
    print

###Sample Output

    [6, 5, 10]
    [1, 5, 9, 10]
    [9, 5, 1]
