##Problem Statement

Python is an interactive language that allows us to execute statements individually and see their results. In other words, you don't have to write a full code and compile it before you execute to see the results as in other languages like C++ and Java.

Here is a sample line of code that can be executed in Python


    print "Hello World!" 

You can even store the string in a variable and then print it:

    my_string = "Hello World!"
    print my_string

The above code will print Hello World! on your screen. You can try it in the console below.
