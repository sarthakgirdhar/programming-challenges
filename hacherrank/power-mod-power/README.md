##Problem Statement

We have only heard of the powers of Python, so far; now we will witness them :)

Power or exponent in Python can be calculated using the built-in power function. Which can be called as for a^b


    >>> pow(a,b) 
or


    >>> a**b
It's also possible to calculate **a^b mod m**.

    >>> pow(a,b,m) 

This is very helpful in computations where you have to print result % mod.

Note that here **a** and **b** can be floats and even negatives; but if a third argument is present, **b** cannot be negative.

**Note** Python has a module math, which has its own pow() but it takes two arguments and returns a float. Frankly speaking, we will never use math.pow()

###Task 
You are given three integers; print two lines. 
The first line should print pow(a,b), and the second line should print the result of pow(a,b,m).

###Input Format 
The first line contains **a**, the second line contains **b**, and the third line contains **m**.

###Constraints 
**1<=a<=10**

**1<=b<=10** 

**2<=m<=1000**
