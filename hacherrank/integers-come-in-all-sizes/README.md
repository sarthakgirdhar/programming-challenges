##Problem Statement

Integers in Python can be as big as the bytes in your machine's memory. There is no limit of **2^31-1** (c++ int) or **2^63-1** (C++ long long int). Let's try this out.

As we know, the result of **a^b** grows really fast with increasing **b**.

We will do some calculations on very large integers.

###Task 
Read four numbers, **a**, **b**, **c**, and **d**, and print the result of **a^b+c^d**.

###Input Format 
Four numbers are given on four lines.

###Constraints 
**1<=a<=1000**

**1<=b<=1000** 

**1<=c<=1000** 

**1<=d<=1000**

###Output Format 
Print the result in one line.

###Sample Input

    9
    29
    7
    27
###Sample Output

    4710194409608608369201743232

Note that this result is bigger than **2^63-1** and hence won't fit in long long int of C++ or a 64-bit integer.
