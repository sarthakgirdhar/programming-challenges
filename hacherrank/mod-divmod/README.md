##Problem Statement

One of the built-in functions of Python is ***divmod***, which takes two arguments **a** and **b** and returns a tuple containing the quotient of **a/b** (**a//b**) and remainder **a**.

Here **a/b** can be compared with integer division **a//b**.

    >>> print divmod(177,10)
    (17, 7)
Here **177//10 => 17** and **177%10 => 7**

###Task 
Read two integers, **a** and **b**, and print three lines. 
The first line is the integer division **a//b** (Remember to import **division** from **__future__**) 

The second line is the result of **a%b**. (Modulo operator) 

In the third line print the divmod of **a** and **b**.

###Input Format 
The first line contains the first integer, **a**, and the second line contains the second integer, **b**.

###Output Format 
Print the result as described above.

###Sample Input

    177
    10
###Sample Output

    17
    7
    (17, 7)
