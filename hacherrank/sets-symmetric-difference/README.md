## Sets - Symmetric Difference


### Problem Statement

Lets learn about a new datatype 'sets'! You are given two set of integers M and N and you have to print their symmetric difference in ascending order. The first line of input contains value of M followed by M integers, then value of N followed by N integers. Symmetric difference between M and N mean those values which either exist in M or in N but not in both.

### Input Format

Value of M followed by M integers, then value of N followed by N integers.

### Output Format

Integers in ascending order, one per line.

### Sample Input

    4
    2 4 5 9
    4
    2 4 11 12

### Sample Output

    5
    9
    11
    12

### Concept

If the inputs are given in one line separated by a space character, use split() to get the splitted values in form of a list. EG:

a = raw_input()

5 4 3 2

lis = a.split()

print (lis)

['5', '4', '3', '2'] 


If the values in a list are all of integer type, use the map() to convert all the strings to integers.


newlis = list(map(int, lis))

print (newlis)

[5, 4, 3, 2] 


Sets are unordered bag of unique values. A single set contains values of any immutable data type. 

CREATING SET 


set = {1, 2} # Directly assigning values to a set

set = set() # Initializing a set

set = set(['a', 'b']) # Creating a set from a list

set

{'a', 'b'}



MODIFYING SET - add() and update() 


set.add('c')

set

{'a', 'c', 'b'}

set.add('a') # As 'a' already exists in the set, nothing happens

set.add((5, 4))

set

{'a', 'c', 'b', (5, 4)} 


set.update([1, 2, 3, 4]) # update() only works for iterable objects

set

{'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 2, (5, 4), 3}

set.update({1, 7, 8})

set

{'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 7, 8, 2, (5, 4), 3}

set.update({1, 6}, [5, 13])

set

{'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2, (5, 4), 13, 3} 


REMOVING ITEMS - discard() and remove() 

Both discard() and remove() take a single value as an argument and removes that value from the set. If that value is not present in the set, discard() does nothing but remove() raises a KeyError exception 


set.discard(10)

set

{'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 5, 7, 8, 2, 12, (5, 4), 13, 11, 3}

set.remove(13)

set

{'a', 1, 'c', 'b', 4, 5, 7, 8, 2, 12, (5, 4), 11, 3} 


COMMON SET OPERATIONS - union(), intersection() and difference() 


a = {2, 4, 5, 9}

b = {2, 4, 11, 12}

a.union(b) # Values which exist in a or b

{2, 4, 5, 9, 11, 12}

a.intersection(b) # Values which exist in a and b

{2, 4}

a.difference(b) # Values which exist in a but not in b

{9, 5} 


union() and intersection() are symmetric methods i.e. to say, 


a.union(b) == b.union(a)

True

a.intersection(b) == b.intersection(a)

True

a.difference(b) == b.difference(a)

False
