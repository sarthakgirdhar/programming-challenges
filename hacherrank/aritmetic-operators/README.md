##Problem Statement

Let's learn about Python's arithmetic operators.

First, let's read two integers:

    a = int(raw_input())
    b = int(raw_input())
Now, the three basic arithmetic operators are the following:

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)

(We'll learn about division in the next task)

###Task 
Read two integers from STDIN and print three lines where: 

(1) the first line contains the sum of the two numbers, 

(2) the second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second), 

(3) the third line contains the product of the two numbers.

###Input Format 
The first line contains the first integer, **a**, and the second line contains the second integer, **b**.

###Constraints 
**1 <= a <= 10^10**

**1 <= b <= 10^10**

###Output Format 
Print three lines as explained above.

###Sample Input

    3
    2
###Sample Output

    5
    1
    6
###Explanation 

**3 + 2 --> 5**

**3 - 2 --> 1** 

**3 * 2 --> 6**
