##Problem Statement

Let's look at Python's input reading method.

    >>> name = raw_input("Hey what's your name?\n")
    Hey what's your name?
    R2D2
    >>> print name
    R2D2

That's one way of doing it for yourself. But in competitive programming we don't ask questions. We only answer them. So we will only use **raw_input()** to read a string without asking any question to the system.

###Task 
Read a string from the console and print it.

###Input Format 
The first and only line of input contains a string.

###Constraints 
String length = 500

###Output Format 
Print the same string back.

###Sample Input

    How many chickens does it take to cross the road?
    
###Sample Output


    How many chickens does it take to cross the road?
